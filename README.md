# NBA-Fantasy-Stats

## Purpose


This project's purpose was to create a website that utilizes info scraped from Rotoworld, stores it in sqlite, and uses Flask and Plotly to display information on the website.


The long-term goal was to create a web application that distilled stats tables full of numbers into easy-to-read charts to give Fantasy Basketball players an easier time with selecting their drafts, as well as making the process easy for anyone interested in starting with Fantasy for the first time.

## Tools Used

* Jupyter Notebook
* SQLite
* SQLAlchemy
* Flask
* HTML5
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* Heroku

The connection between Flask, SQLite and our front-end HTML page was derived from [one of our Bootcamp homework assignments](https://github.com/RutgersCodingBootcamp/RUTSOM201805DATA1-Class-Repository-DATA/tree/master/02-HomeWork/15-Interactive-Visualizations-and-Dashboards).

## Results

Our website is deployed on Heroku: [NBA Fantasy Destroyer](https://nbafantasydestroyer.herokuapp.com)
